Today, I spent a few hours learning about [SVG](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalable_Vector_Graphics).

As some of you may know, SVG stands for Scalable Vector Graphics, and is an application of XML. It's the use of XML to
describe a drawing. It can be used to generate line graphs and pie charts and stuff at runtime from data in a database
or whatever.

If you've ever programmed in Dynamic HTML (using the DOM or whatever) then SVG would make sense to you. Each line
segment, circle, etc. is an XML element, and can be accessed in the XML DOM the same way as HTML elements in an HTML
DOM. SVG elements provide styles, and can be used with CSS files (with properties specific to SVG), and SVG elements
also fire events, such as onmouseover, so that drawings may be interactive.

But then I found out that stupid Internet Explorer doesn't natively support SVG. It's possible to view SVG graphics
using Adobe's SVG Viewer plug-in, which is roughly 1 mb.

And then I found out that stupid Internet Explorer doesn't really even support XHTML. It only has a half-assed hack
to support SVG inline an XHTML document, and even then I can't use it when I supply an XHTML DOCTYPE declaration,
which is supposed to be part of XHTML documents.

When will Microsoft build a standards-compliant browser?
