So here we are again, back online with a new blog.

This time I'm here using a new blog based on the excellent [DocPad platform](http://docpad.org/), running on the [Windows Azure](http://www.windowsazure.com/) Cloud.

I've used [Erv Walter's blog](http://www.ewal.net/2013/10/08/blogging-with-docpad/) as a starting point, so the theme of my blog looks almost exactly like his at this point.
I'm going to be making changes to this as I go so that it ends up looking the way I like.

I haven't blogged in some time but I hope to keep going with this one, with posts on a variety of topics that interest me, and hopefully, many of you.
