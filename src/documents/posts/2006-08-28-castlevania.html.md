I took today off because it was a Sunday. Well, I didn't exactly take the whole day off, I still
did a significant amount of work, but I gave myself time to play quite a bit of CastleVania.

Yay, CastleVania.

Definitely one of my favorite games of all time, although it's a bit short.

I did my one-life run through. My subweapon: Holy Water Triple Shot Multiplier. There's a Holy Water
at the top of the stairs in the first level. I get it and then keep it until I beat Dracula with it.
It's definitely the easiest way to beat the game.

But afterwards, I decided to give myself a bit of a challenge and try playing the game with a different
subweapon. Or maybe a different subweapon each day. Today, I tried using the dagger.
There's a dagger right in front of the castle, so I got it and tried to keep it until I beat Dracula with it.

The Big Bat at the end of the first set of stages gave me more trouble than I had hoped. I wasn't used to using
the dagger yet at this point (because when I normally play, I NEVER use the dagger). I didn't lose any lives here,
though.

Queen Medusa at the end of the second set of stages gave me quite a bit of trouble. Until today, I didn't know
what the boss really did. Like, how it moves, how it attacks, and so on. I didn't lose a life, but I almost
did, as the boss left me with only 2 units of life.

The Mummy Men at the end of the third set of stages were really easy. I didn't even need to use the dagger.

Frankenstein's Monster and Igor were much easier than I was expecting. I only got hit once by this duo.

The Grim Reaper, however, was a different story. My usual subweapon against this monster is Holy Water
(which, if you have never seen it, you would never believe is the best subweapon against this boss).
Aside from the first few times I beat this boss using the Cross, I had never had to deal with the
randomly-appearing scythes.

Since I was playing this on an emulator (typical disclaimers, yes I own the game cartridge, yatta yatta yatta...),
I decided to create a save state right before the Grim Reaper appeared. I somehow knew I wouldn't be able to
do this in one life. But I told myself I would not save during the boss battle. If my character died, then
I would load from before the boss appeared. In other words, each try would be a separate attempt.

The result, probably over 20 tries. But I got the hang of it, and now I can probably do it every time.
Practice makes perfect, huh.

The rest of the game... The hardest part is definitely the second half of the clock tower, once the
flea men start appearing. It's all about losing as little life as possible on that part of the level.

Once I can get to Dracula, the rest is simple. All I have to watch out for is Dracula appearing right
on top of me during his teleports. The second phase of Dracula is even easier.

So there's a brief log of my run through CastleVania, using just a dagger.

I think I'm going to do it again, and post screenshots or something. And while I'm at it,
I guess I can do the same with Gradius :) Stay tuned.

And someone teach me how to put pictures inline my LiveJournal entries, please??
