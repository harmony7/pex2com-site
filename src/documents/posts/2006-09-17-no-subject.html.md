First, I was going to rant about how much it sucks not being able to get on internet very often.
It's been a week since I last checked e-mail -- there were over 400 pieces of e-mail in my inbox
(380 of which was spam).

Just right now, MS-IME crashed on me, causing me to restart my journal entry.
It caused enough shit to bring down Windows. It might have to do with Automatic Updates,
which seems to have been eating up all the CPU at the time Windows crashed. Oh well.

I lost two hard drives this week. It is really sad.

The first (a 250 GB Maxtor) started failing, about 4 days ago. Maxtor's PowerMax diagnostic tool
told me that "THE DRIVE IS FAILING. COPY DATA TO ANOTHER DRIVE AND REPLACE ASAP." or something to that effect.

So I copied as much data as i could (that i decided was necessary) onto my other (100 GB IBM) drive.
The next day, that drive died with no warning.

So, I currently have no working hard drive on my desktop.
