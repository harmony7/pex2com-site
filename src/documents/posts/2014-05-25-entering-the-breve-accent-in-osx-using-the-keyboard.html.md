Today I had the need to enter English text into a document that used breve and macron accents.  These symbols are generally
used to denote "short" and "long" vowel pronunciations for introductory English learning material, and look like these:

&#259; &amacr;

In Mac OS X, it is possible out of the box to enter modified letters simply by holding the base key on the keyboard until
a popup is displayed.  Then one would simply select the desired letter.

However, notice that this popup contains a version of the letter a with the macron accent but not one with the breve accent.
I needed a way to enter this character using the keyboard.

Mac OS X, like many other operating systems, has a system called "dead keys", which allows the user to enter a key that,
when used by itself does not produce a character. Instead, this key modifies the next character pressed. For example, it is
possible to type Option-E to produce the dead key for Â´, which would modify the next key by applying an acute accent.

[Option-E][a] &rarr; &aacute;

The following screen shot shows the layout of these dead keys on my keyboard, as seen through the keyboard viewer tool.

The keys displayed here in orange are the dead keys.  But notice that our breve accent is not one of the dead keys!
How can I get the breve accent?

It turns out that by switching the keyboard layout from U.S. to one called U.S. Extended, different dead keys appear when
the option key is pressed:

![U.S. Extended](/stuff/2014/05/us-ext-opt.png)

Now it is possible to access the breve accent by using Option-B.

[Option-B][a] &rarr; &#259;

My next question at this point is this: is there a way to enter the connecting double breve: o&#861;o ?

It doesn't really look like it yet.  I looked, but it doesn't seem to be available on the keyboard, even using the U.S.
Extended keyboard layout.  In HTML it's possible to achieve using the &amp;#861; character between the two characters
being linked.  And for use in documents / presentations, I'll just have to copy and paste from the generated HTML for now.

[HTML] o&amp;#861;o &rarr; o&#861;o
