Recently, I haven't been keeping up very well with my LiveJournal.

As I've been ranting about in the past, my situation at work isn't too good. My girlfriend left the workplace, and
now I plan on leaving by the end of the year.

I'm going to be off to Tokyo.

Very likely, I will be in Tokyo by January, and I will begin an entirely new phase in my life. I really look forward
to it, even though it will begin with a very small room and my paying off previous debts. After all that, I'll be
living a very meaningful and fulfilling life.

As for games...

I don't have money right now, so I really don't have the opportunity to play anything for any of the new systems.
All I do recently is bring up my old favorites in a NES emulator (FCE Ultra).

I mentioned Gradius and CastleVania below. I also played Konami World lately, and I completed it in one sitting
(even though the vertical scrolling levels aren't emulated very well by FCEU yet).

I'm sorry my life is so boring at the moment. I'll have much more to say after I'm in Tokyo.

Oh, I guess I should also mention that I'm about halfway through with revising
the Portopia Serial Murder Case script. When that's complete, a
[new version will be released by the DvD Translations group](http://dvdtranslations.eludevisibility.org/portopia.html).
