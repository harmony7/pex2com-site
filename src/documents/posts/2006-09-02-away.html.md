Today, I'm at my Mom's and sister's house.

I took a day off from my not-so-fun workplace, and took the train here. The city I'm in is called Komatsu.
The name may sound familiar from the name Komatsu Forklift. They originated here, and the factory is pretty
close to the house.

I have some bad news. I won't be able to come online very often fo a while (unknown period of time).

I will check my mail and LiveJournal as often as I can, probably twice a week tops. But I love all of you.
I will wait for the day that I can come back to the Internet every day.

See you around.
