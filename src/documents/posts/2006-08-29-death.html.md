I've always called this character the Grim Reaper, although I guess the character should be called DEATH since that's
what they call him in all the new releases (even on the Japanese versions).

I recorded this today, here's me taking on the evil thing with a triple shot dagger.

I wanted to record it with sound but RockNESX seems to screw with the system's timer or something,
and it throws off "ojos", my recording program. I asked it to record at 24 fps, but it actually seems
to have recorded it at a slightly higher rate. It plays back at 24 fps, though, so it plays back more
slowly than how i recorded it. And when I record it with sound, everything gets all out of sync and it's gross.

Maybe I'll try a different emulator...
