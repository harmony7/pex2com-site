Today you'll notice a new little widget added to the sidebar of this site.

It's a quick partial view I wrote for [DocPad](http://docpad.org/) that runs a script to display the Internet Time.

In 2001 I had the opportunity to play the online video game
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phantasy_Star_Online" target="_blank">Phantasy Star Online</a>,
which used a strange unit of time called the beat.

This was the <a href="http://www.swatch.com/zz_en/internettime/" target="_blank">Swatch beat, otherwise known as Internet Time</a>.
It had been incorporated as a way to make it easier for international players to schedule their next online game,
by eliminating time zones. The day would be divided into 1000 equal "beats", and the 0th beat would correspond with
midnight in Switzerland (Swatch is a Swiss company).  This fascinated me, because I had always been wondering why
people had not been able to settle on a single time zone for the entire world.

In the end, I feel very few players ended up using the beat time as a way to decide when to meet next.
The idea of a time system that doesn't flow well with people's daily workflow probably doesn't work very well.

However, my fascination with Internet Time still lives on, and several times over the last 10 years I have written
widgets to display Internet Time in various locations, including my computer desktop and on websites.
This is the fourth incarnation of this widget and I like the way it looks.

And the green bar is a kickback to the Internet Time clock in Phantasy Star Online. =D
