It's been three weeks already since I posted last.

I'm sort of an extreme person, and by this what I mean is that although things about me change often, I'm usually
not in the middle of the spectrum, but at one extreme end or the other.

I'm either extremely happy or extremely sad. I'm either extremely satisfied or extremely in need. I'm either
extremely organized or extremely disorganized. So I'm either well on track or way off track.

I guess I'm a big slacker and I need to fix that. Like soon. But what always happens is I end up imposing rules
on myself that are far too difficult to follow. And then I end up not being able to follow them, and then I fall
out of line again, and then I'm back where I've started, having gained nothing, but possible having lost even more
confidence in myself.

I guess I'm too hard on myself. I need to let myself be what it wants to be.

But I can't, because I'm too much a perfectionist. I'm never happy with anything I do so I can never get anything
into the world. Everything I release into the world, be it some piece of text, a poem, or something I turn into my
boss at work, takes far too long for me to complete because I am never happy with my work.

I guess I think too hard about everything.

I haven't been able to come to any conclusions today. I will go to bed on this, and hopefully I'll come up with
something tomorrow.
