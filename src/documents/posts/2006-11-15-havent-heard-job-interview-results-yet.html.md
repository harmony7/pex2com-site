I wonder what's going to happen.

I feel like I'm in a state of limbo. I can't start looking for other jobs yet. I guess all I can do is wait.

So I just sat at home today downloading software (mainly Java SDK, Windows SDK, and DirectX SDK) and reading
computer books (such as Programming Role Playing Games with DirectX, 2nd Edition).

I guess it's okay though. Once I get the job and start working, I won't have time to sit and freely study.

I'm going to spend some time and brush up on programming skills. I'll need them at work.
