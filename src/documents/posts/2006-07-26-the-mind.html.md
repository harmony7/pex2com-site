The human mind is really interesting...

Until about last night I was so upset about work and the way I felt towards my superiors. Nothing went well at work,
everything sucked, and all I thought about every day was leaving and going home and returning to my hobbies, or just
going straight to sleep.

But I had a bit of an epiphany today, and suddenly I can look at everything in a different light. All I did was think
about my superiors and why they are trusted with such a position, whereas I am not. I realized that although I'd
thought I'd been paying respect to my superiors, I was in actuality (at least in my mind) putting them down.

In other words, they have all the experience and knowledge acquired during the process of assuming that position.

It's that small amount of change in direction in my mind. That's all it took, and today I feel so much better towards work.
