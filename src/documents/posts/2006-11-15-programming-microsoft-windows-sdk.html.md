Microsoft Windows SDK for Windows Vista and .NET Framework 3.0 has been released. Apparently it was released on
November 4, almost two weeks ago.

This SDK can also be used to write programs for Windows XP SP2 as well as .NET Framework 2.0. In effect,
they've taken the former Platform SDK and the .NET Framework SDK, and combined them into one big package.

The download size is 1.15 GB. Yeah.

So I'm downloading it right now.

If you're interested, you can download it too.
