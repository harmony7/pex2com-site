I felt like pulling up Gradius (Konami) for NES today.

It's cool how i can do that and my hands still remember the game.
I got through the game twice on my first life, and died on the second level on
the third run. At that time, I had about 20 extra lives, but that far into the
game it's next to impossible to recover after losing everything, and I couldn't do it.

Tomorrow I guess I'll play CastleVania...
