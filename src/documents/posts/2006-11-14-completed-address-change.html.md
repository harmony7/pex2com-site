So I ended up walking to the Police Headquarters.

There was no line, and the actual paperwork and processing took a total of about five minutes.

I received a form, I wrote my new address on it, and pasted the photograph I purchased earlier onto it, and turned
it in. The girl at the window took my driver's license, wrote my new address on the back (handwrote it),
and then put some red stamp on it.

That's it.

It cost me nothing.

I got tired though, so on my way home I stopped by the arcade to play a little bit of IIDX. 300 yen worth.
I've really lost my touch.

And then on my way home it suddenly started raining cats and dogs. I got all wet. So I'm going to go change. :p
