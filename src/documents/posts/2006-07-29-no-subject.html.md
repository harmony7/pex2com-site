This is a bit of an extension to my last post.

My boss chewed me out pretty badly today, but I was entirely at fault. She can see through things about me, my bad
habits, and where and why I make my mistakes.

Of course, nobody likes to be criticized, so for a second I feel like talking back, but then I realize that she is
telling me all this for my sake, and it's for my own good.

We all have to remember that we're all part of an ongoing process of developing.
