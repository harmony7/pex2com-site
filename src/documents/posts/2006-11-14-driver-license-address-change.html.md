I have just this left to do...

I was told that I can file for this at any police station, so I walked to the nearest one, and guess what,
there is no one inside, as the only policeman on duty is out patroling!

What a peaceful country. We're talking about the police station right in front of the train station.
Where am I supposed to go if I get pickpocketed or something?

Anyway, I am left with no choice but to go to the next nearest police station ... the Komatsu Police
Headquarters. Fortunately, it's not that far, so I'm on my way there. Yes, I'm walking.

Oh, the application form to file for this address change requires me to paste an ID photograph of
myself (24 mm x 30 mm, ID-size). I went to the convenience store on my way here and it cost me
700 yen (about $5.75) to take one stupid tiny photo. How expensive!

I hope filing for the address change won't cost me any...
