If you haven't seen this movie yet, and you don't want to see any spoilers, then skip reading this entry.

All right, I saw this freaky movie last week.

I remember reading "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory", the original novel by Roald Dahl, as a first grader.
And compared to what I remember from that...

This movie alters the original book in many ways that are very scary.

Yeah, my first impression, upon seeing Charlie Bucket, his mom and dad, and Grandpa Joe were very encouraging.
The crooked house was cute, albeit unrealistic.

But my opinion started changing when I saw... Augustus Gloop.

Is it me or is his face computer generated? When I saw the scene where he recalls biting into the candy bar that
had his Golden Ticket, the skin on his face looked... well, inorganic, like it was made of vinyl. This kid was
just... repulsive.

And then Mike Teavee. Oh, this kid looked organic, but he is such a destructive kid. How old is he, and what are his
parents thinking, letting him play a corridor shooter like that at that age?

Finally, it's when I saw Willy Wonka, that I thought this movie was not the novel that I knew. The impression that I
had of Willy Wonka since about 20 years ago was of... well, a bit older than this guy. And what was this weird, weird,
weird subplot about his father?

And then, we have the Oompa Loompas. To quote my friend, "the fact that they were all played by a single Sri Lankan
midget was something bound to be either incredibly funny or incredibly scary."

There were a few parts that I laughed about, because they were so silly. Willy Wonka's bit about cannibalism was
one of these, as well as the boat being rowed and the rowing being controlled by a Oompa Loompa with a tympani.

If you want to be freaked out, yeah, go rent this movie or something.
