Thanks to an invitation by my friend Hiviki, I was able to join [mixi](http://mixi.jp/) (a Japanese SNS) today.

At the current time, my life is rather unpredictable, and although I now have some more control over it than in the
past, I'm doing things such as moving, and things have yet to calm down.

With all that going on, however, I've come to decide on one thing: Next April I will be moving not to Tokyo, but to
Nagoya (third largest city in Japan, after Tokyo and Osaka). Until then I will be living with my mom, in Komatsu.

My mom wants to move to a bigger apartment (within Komatsu) soon, so I'll be moving along with her.

Regarding work, it will probably be starting next week. Temporary worker at a computer software company
until the end of March. Wish me luck!
